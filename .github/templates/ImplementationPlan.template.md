title: Project Implementation Plan (v1.1)
schemaVersion: 1.1
description: 'Slim template for planning discrete project tasks across any domain'

## Planning Prompt
Design and execute a stepwise implementation plan for the assigned project task. Ensure all objectives, deliverables, and milestones are addressed, risks are mitigated, and verification steps are completed. Communicate progress, clarify requirements as needed, and update documentation to reflect changes and ownership.

## 1. Objective
**Concise goal statement**: [What will be accomplished and why it matters]

## 2. Success Criteria
- **Functional outcome**: [Core deliverable that must work/be completed]
- **Quality standards**: [Performance, maintainability, security, or other non-functional requirements]
- **Done definition**: [Specific, measurable criteria for completion]

## 3. Scope
**In-Scope**:
- [Primary features/components to be delivered]
- [Systems/areas that will be modified]

**Out-of-Scope**:
- [Features/components explicitly excluded]
- [Future enhancements or related work deferred]

## 4. Key Deliverables
| Artifact | Purpose | Completion Criteria |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| [Component/File/System] | [What it enables/solves] | [How to verify it's done] |
| [Documentation/Config] | [Knowledge transfer/setup] | [Acceptance standard] |

## 5. Milestones & Timeline
| Milestone | Target Timeline | Exit Criteria |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| [Phase/Checkpoint] | [Rough timeframe] | [Measurable completion signal] |
| [Integration point] | [Dependencies resolved] | [Validation completed] |

## 6. Workflow
1. **Requirements clarification** - Validate assumptions, gather missing details
2. **Design outline** - Create lightweight architecture/approach
3. **Incremental implementation** - Build/deliver in testable chunks
4. **Review & refinement** - Incorporate feedback, address gaps
5. **Final verification** - Complete testing, documentation, handoff

## 7. Assumptions
- [Technical/environmental assumptions that affect the plan]
- [Availability of resources, tools, or dependencies]
- [Stakeholder availability or decision-making timeline]

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Technical challenge] | [High/Med/Low] | [Specific prevention/response action] |
| [Resource constraint] | [High/Med/Low] | [Alternative approach/contingency] |

## 9. Verification & Quality
- **Automated checks**: [Unit tests, linting, CI/CD validation]
- **Manual validation**: [User testing, integration verification, review steps]
- **Performance/compliance**: [Benchmarks, standards, regulatory requirements]

## 10. Handoff & Ownership
- **Primary owner**: [Person/team responsible for delivery]
- **Reviewers/approvers**: [Stakeholders for sign-off]
- **Documentation updated**: [ ] README/wiki [ ] Change log [ ] Architecture docs

## 11. Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Objectives clearly defined with measurable outcomes
- [ ] Scope boundaries explicit (in/out of scope documented)
- [ ] Key deliverables enumerated with completion criteria
- [ ] Timeline realistic with dependency considerations
- [ ] Risks identified with concrete mitigation strategies
- [ ] Verification steps defined for quality assurance
- [ ] Ownership and handoff plan established
- [ ] Assumptions documented and validated

## 12. Template Notes
**Version**: Universal implementation planning template (v1.1)  
**Philosophy**: Keep slim and actionable - expand sections only when complexity demands it  
**Usage**: Adapt section depth based on project size and risk profile
