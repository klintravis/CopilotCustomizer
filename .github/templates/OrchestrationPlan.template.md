title: Orchestration Plan
schemaVersion: 1.0
description: 'Template for plans/PLAN.md files generated by orchestrated multi-agent systems'

## Planning Prompt
Track orchestrated multi-agent workflow execution through phases with quality gates, TDD lifecycle, and state tracking. Update this plan as phases complete and quality gates are evaluated.

## 1. Summary
- **Project**: [Project name and goal]
- **System**: [System name] ([Orchestra | Atlas | Custom] pattern)
- **Conductor**: [Conductor agent name]
- **Subagents**: [Comma-separated list of subagent names]
- **TDD Enforcement**: [strict | relaxed | none]
- **Parallel Execution**: [true | false]

## 2. Phase Definitions

| Phase | Name | Agent | Input | Output | Quality Gate |
|-------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | [Phase name] | [Agent] | [What it receives] | [What it produces] | [Gate name or None] |
| 2 | [Phase name] | [Agent] | [What it receives] | [What it produces] | [Gate name or None] |
| 3 | [Phase name] | [Agent] | [What it receives] | [What it produces] | [Gate name or None] |

## 3. Quality Gates

### Gate 1: [Gate Name]
- **After Phase**: [phase number]
- **Criteria**:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
  - [ ] [Criterion 3]
- **Outcomes**: APPROVED → proceed | NEEDS_REVISION → return to phase | FAILED → escalate
- **Result**: [pending]

### Gate 2: [Gate Name]
- **After Phase**: [phase number]
- **Criteria**:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
- **Outcomes**: APPROVED → proceed | NEEDS_REVISION → return to phase | FAILED → escalate
- **Result**: [pending]

### Gate 3: [Gate Name]
- **After Phase**: [phase number]
- **Criteria**:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
- **Outcomes**: APPROVED → proceed | FAILED → block commit
- **Result**: [pending]

## 4. TDD Lifecycle

### Per-Phase TDD Requirements
For each implementation phase (when TDD enforcement = strict):

| Step | Action | Verification |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Plan | Define requirements and acceptance criteria | Documented in this plan |
| Test | Write failing tests that define expected behavior | Tests fail as expected |
| Implement | Write code to make tests pass | All tests pass |
| Review | Validate quality and correctness | Review report generated |
| Commit | Stage and commit changes | PLAN.md updated |

## 5. State Tracking

- **Current Phase**: [phase name or "Not started"]
- **Status**: [NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | AWAITING_APPROVAL | COMPLETED]
- **Completed Phases**: [list]
- **Blocking Issues**: [list or "None"]
- **Next Action**: [description]

## 6. Progress Log

| Timestamp | Phase | Event | Agent | Details |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| [datetime] | — | System initialized | Conductor | Awaiting start |

## 7. Parallel Execution Plan (Atlas pattern only)

### Parallel Groups
| Group | Agents | Files Scope | Dependencies |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| [Group A] | [Agent-1, Agent-2] | [glob patterns] | [prerequisite phases] |

### Synchronization Points
- After Group [X] completes → proceed to Phase [Y]

## 8. Final Report (generated on completion)

### Completion Summary
- **Total Phases**: [count]
- **Quality Gates Passed**: [count]/[total]
- **TDD Results**: [tests written], [tests passing]
- **Files Created/Modified**: [count]
- **Duration**: [total time]

### Artifacts
| File | Action | Phase |
|------|--------|-------|
| [file path] | [created | modified] | [phase number] |
