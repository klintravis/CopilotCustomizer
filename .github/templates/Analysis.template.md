# Analysis Template (Universal)

**Purpose**: Consistent, actionable structure for project analyses across any repository type (architecture reviews, workflow assessments, code audits, refactoring plans, security evaluations, performance studies, etc.). Keep concise and results-oriented.

## Summary (≤3 bullets)
- What was analyzed (scope, components, timeframe)
- Key finding(s) or primary insights discovered
- Recommended action or decision needed

## Context (≤2 bullets)
- Inputs/signals considered (files, metrics, requirements, constraints, stakeholder feedback)
- Key assumptions or limitations affecting the analysis

## Findings (≤5 bullets)
- Primary observation or pattern identified
- Supporting evidence or data points
- Secondary insights or correlations
- Notable gaps or missing information
- Comparative analysis (if applicable)

## Risks & Mitigations (optional, ≤3)
- **Risk**: [Impact/Likelihood] → **Mitigation**: [Specific action/control]
- **Risk**: [Technical/Business concern] → **Mitigation**: [Prevention/response strategy]
- **Risk**: [Implementation challenge] → **Mitigation**: [Alternative approach/safeguard]

## Next Steps (≤3)
- **Immediate**: [Action item] (Owner: [Role/Team])
- **Short-term**: [Follow-up task] (Owner: [Role/Team])
- **Long-term**: [Strategic initiative] (Owner: [Role/Team])

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Analysis scope clearly defined and bounded
- [ ] Findings supported by evidence or clear reasoning
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable
- [ ] Risks identified with concrete mitigation strategies
- [ ] Next steps include ownership and rough timelines
- [ ] No placeholders or undefined references remain
- [ ] Repository-specific paths and components referenced when relevant
